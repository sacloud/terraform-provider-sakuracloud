# SakuraCloud Provider

The SakuraCloud Provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by its APIs.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    sakuracloud = {
      source = "sacloud/sakuracloud"

      # We recommend pinning to the specific version of the SakuraCloud Provider you're using
      # since new versions are released frequently
      version = "2.25.5"
      #version = "~> 2"
    }
  }
}
# Configure the SakuraCloud Provider
provider "sakuracloud" {
  # More information on the authentication methods supported by
  # the SakuraCloud Provider can be found here:
  # https://docs.usacloud.jp/terraform/provider/

  # profile = "..."
}
```

## Authentication Methods

The SakuraCloud provider supports following authentication methods:

- Static credentials
- Shared credentials file
- Environment variables

### Static credentials ###

!> **Warning:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not
recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding a `token` and `secret`
in-line in the SakuraCloud provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "sakuracloud" {
  token  = "my-access-token"
  secret = "my-access-secret"
  zone   = "is1a"
}
```
### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `SAKURACLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` and
`SAKURACLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, environment variables, representing your 
Access Token and your Access Secret, respectively. 

```hcl
provider "sakuracloud" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export SAKURACLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-access-token"
$ export SAKURACLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="my-access-secret"
$ export SAKURACLOUD_ZONE="is1a"
$ terraform plan
```

### Shared credentials file

You can use a shared credentials file by specifying `profile` parameter.
A shared credentials file is formatted as JSON, the default location is `$HOME/.usacloud/<profile name>/config.json` on Linux and OS X, or
`"%USERPROFILE%\.usacloud\<profile name>/config.json"` for Windows users.

Example shared credentials file is follows:

```json
{
	"AccessToken": "my-access-token",
	"AccessTokenSecret": "my-access-secret",
	"Zone": "is1a"
}
```
