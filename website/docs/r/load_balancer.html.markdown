## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new LoadBalancer
resource "sakuracloud_load_balancer" "foobar" {
  name = "foobar"

  switch_id         = sakuracloud_switch.foobar.id
  vrid              = 1
  high_availability = false
  plan              = "standard"

  ipaddress1 = "192.168.2.1"
  # only when high_availability = true 
  #ipaddress2        = "192.168.2.2"
  
  nw_mask_len   = 24
  default_route = "192.168.2.254"

  vips {
    vip          = "192.168.2.101"
    port         = 80
    delay_loop   = 10
    sorry_server = "192.168.2.11"
    
    servers {
      ipaddress      = "192.168.2.102"
      check_protocol = "http"
      check_path     = "/ping.html"
      check_status   = 200
    }
    servers {
      ipaddress      = "192.168.2.103"
      check_protocol = "http"
      check_path     = "/ping.html"
      check_status   = 200
    }
  }

  description = "description"
  tags        = ["foo", "bar"]
}

resource "sakuracloud_switch" "foobar" {
