# sakuracloud\_server

Provides a SakuraCloud Server resource. This can be used to create, update, and delete Servers.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new Server
resource sakuracloud_server "foobar" {
  name                = "foobar"
  # core              = 1
  # memory            = 1
  disks               = ["${sakuracloud_disk.foobar.id}"]
  # interface_driver  = "virtio"
  # nic               = "shared"
  
  # cdrom_id          = "${sakuracloud_cdrom.foobar.id}"
  # private_host_id   = "${sakuracloud_private_host.foobar.id}"
  
  # additional_nics   = [
  #  "${sakuracloud_switch.foobar.id}",  # connect to switch
  #  "", # disconnected
  # ] 
  
  # packet_filter_ids = [
  #  "${sakuracloud_packet_filter.foobar.id}", # for primary NIC
  #  "${sakuracloud_packet_filter.foobar.id}", # for secondly NIC
  #]
 
  # only when nic != shared
  # ipaddress       = "192.2.0.1"
  # nw_mask_len     = 24
  # gateway         = "192.2.0.254" 
  
  description       = "description"
  tags              = ["foo", "bar"]
}

# Create a new Disk
resource sakuracloud_disk "foobar" {
  name              = "foobar"
  plan              = "ssd"
  connector         = "virtio"
  size              = 20
  source_archive_id = "${data.sakuracloud_archive.ubuntu.id}"
  # or
  # source_disk_id  = "<your-disk-id>"
  
  # For "Modify Disk" API
  hostname          = "your-host-name"
  password          = ""
  ssh_key_ids       = ["<your-ssh-key-id>"]
  note_ids          = ["<your-note-id"]
  disable_pw_auth   = true
  
  description       = "description"
  tags              = ["foo", "bar"]
}

# Source archive
data sakuracloud_archive "ubuntu" {
  os_type = "ubuntu"
